# Welcome to the Python Image Processing Project Repository! ðŸŽ¨ðŸ“Š

## Purpose of This Repository

The main goal of this GitHub repository is to **provide a clear explanation** of two Python scripts that demonstrate **image processing techniques**. These scripts focus on two distinct methods for improving image quality:

1. **Restoration Using Neural Networks**:
   - This script uses modern machine learning techniques, including **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**, to clean noisy images and improve their visual quality.

2. **Frequency Domain Filtering**:
   - This script uses classical mathematical techniques, such as **Fourier Transform**, to clean images by applying frequency filters (lowpass, highpass, and bandpass) to remove noise and enhance features.

## What's Inside?

### 1. **Python Scripts**
- These two scripts are:
  - `neural_network_restoration.py`: Explains how to use machine learning models for image restoration.
  - `frequency_domain_filters.py`: Demonstrates classical filtering methods using frequency domain techniques.

### 2. **Detailed Documentation**
- Every mathematical calculation and concept used in the scripts is **thoroughly explained** in accompanying markdown files:
  - `math_calculations.md`: Explains the math behind the frequency domain filtering methods.
  - This README file itself offers an overview of the repository's purpose.

### 3. **For Beginners and Learners**
- The repository is designed to be **easy to understand**, even for beginners:
  - If you're unfamiliar with Python or image processing, don't worry! The explanations break down complex ideas into simple, digestible concepts.
  - We've even included examples and comparisons to help you understand the results.

## How to Use This Repository

### Step 1: Explore the Scripts
Look at the Python scripts to understand the methods:
- **Neural Network Restoration**: Learn how AI models clean noisy images.
- **Frequency Domain Filtering**: Understand how math filters noise from images.

### Step 2: Read the Documentation
Dive into the markdown files to understand the calculations, logic, and techniques used in the scripts.

### Step 3: Run the Code
Follow the instructions in each script to test the methods yourself. You'll see how images are cleaned and enhanced using both approaches.

## Why Is This Important?

- **Image processing** is a fundamental concept in fields like photography, medicine, satellite imaging, and AI.
- Understanding these techniques will give you insight into how computers and math work together to make images look better.
